# Onedata Drive

**The application is currently under development. Available installation packages are alpha versions. It is not intended for use with production data!**

Onedata Drive is a graphical interface application allowing Windows users to work with data stored in Onedata system. 

## Requirements
- Supported Windows version: **Windows 10 (version 1803 +)** and **Windows 11**
- **.NET Desktop Runtime 8** must be installed
- Before the installation of the new version, **the old version has to be uninstalled**  (The installer will be improved later to make this step unnecessary)
- You should not need to run as admin, as long you have access to the Root Folder

## Running the app
- in order to access files Onedata Drive must be running
- every time you restart computer/app and connect again new session is created
- connecting to big spaces (with many folders) might take a long time (up to several minutes)
- **Oneprovider Token** must have REST/CDMI access
- If you want refresh folder (show changes perfomed on cloud): `Right Click (On empty space) -> Show more options -> Onedata Drive -> Refresh Current Folder`

### Filling the connect form
All options can be set in the graphicall user interface. You can fill the connect form manually or you can load existing configuration file (`Advanced` -> `Load configuration from file`). 

**Configuration JSON file example:**
```
{
    "onezone" : "datahub.egi.eu",
    "provider_token" : "TOKEN",
    "root_path" : "C:\\Users\\user\\Onedata\\"
}
```

### Configuration
 The configuration is stored in the file at `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\OnedataDrive\UserSettings.config`. 

Selected configuration options:

- **Root Folder**
    - path to the local folder where directories and files are synced.
    - the original contents of the directory will be deleted when connecting.
- **Oneprovider token**
    - must have REST/CDMI access,
    - must have access to Oneproviders (Onezone access is not required),
    - limiting token access to specific paths (during token creation) might not work as expected with spaces of which you are not owner.

## Logging
Files with logs can be found at `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\OnedataDrive\logs\`. 

## In case of app failure
- If the app crashes and you can not reconnect to the cloud restarting computer should fix the issue.
- If the app is not running, but sync root (OneData) is still present you may try using `Advanced -> Remove SyncRoot`

## Notes
- Does not work in Windows Sandbox. In virtual machine (e.g. in Hyper-V) it works fine.
- The application is not signed, so Windows Defender SmartScreen might block it. You can run it anyway by clicking `More info` and `Run anyway`.
